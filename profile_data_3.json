I am a very strong advocate of Wikipedia in Hebrew and actively canvas multiple Israeli Government Ministries continuously to budget more finance to translate existing Wikipedia Articles in other languages to Hebrew. Hebrew Wikipedia has about 191,000 articles as of June 2016. The first article in Hebrew was published in May 2001.Wikipedia Articles are  not technically copyrighted but if its content is used , the source should be acknowledged in full and accurately and with the URL link.From its inception in 2001, Wikipedia articles have been regarded as credible and acceptable academic sources (subject to any editorial comment) Wikipedia can best be described as Crowd Editing. Anyone can register on Wikipedia and contribute to an exciting article or start one of their own. Anything added to articles are closely monitored and checked under very well defined guidelines of Wikipedia.There are absolutely no bylines or acknowledgement of authorship of Wikipedia  articles , Any contributions to Wikipedia are probono with no exceptions.The English Edition of Wikipedia has grown to over  5,171,461 articles,( as a t11th June 2016 6am GMT)equivalent to over 2,000 print volumes of the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica. Including all language editions, Wikipedia has over 40 million articles, equivalent to over 17,000 print volumes of the last print edition of . Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica"

The Internet quite frankly did not have enough broadband . Only half the assignments were submitted over the Internet , the rest bounced and were submitted by Courier Service. The Courses revolved round Database Management and Internet Technology which of course have come a long way since then. Among the languages also studied in this degree were Pascal, an early version of C , COBOL, RPG ( for the IBM AS 400)   and Fortran and an early version of Basic .That constituted a high % of the then languages. Today there are 1000's and many have been ported to Windows.net and Linux. Part of the degree revolved round identifying viruses and there was even an exercise to actually write one =:)"
