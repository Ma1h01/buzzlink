My diverse experiences across software engineering, product management, and hands-on projects have equipped me with the skills needed to thrive in fast-paced, collaborative environments.\n\nDuring my internship at Shipt, I worked closely with cross-functional teams to enhance customer engagement by developing new email formats that reached over a million users. Collaborating with marketing, UI/UX, and engineering teams, I utilized HTML, Javascript, and CSS to design and implement efficient, scalable systems. This experience sharpened my ability to manage and execute technical projects, while also driving impactful user-focused solutions.\n\nAt eClinicalWorks, as a Product Manager Intern, I focused on improving system efficiency by working closely with engineers, product managers, and customer support teams. I gained valuable experience in identifying project needs, resolving technical challenges, and ensuring timely delivery of solutions.\n\nIn addition to my professional experiences, my academic projects at Georgia Tech have provided me with a strong technical foundation. I developed an Android Tower Defense game using Kotlin, collaborated on data visualization tools using JavaScript to map large datasets, and led a startup project focused on creating a virtual reality (VR) solution for users to try on clothes. These experiences have helped me refine my problem-solving skills and explore cutting-edge technologies like VR and data visualization.\n\nI am always eager to learn and grow, continuously adapting to new environments and challenges. Whether it\u2019s working on distributed systems, optimizing software, or exploring innovative user experiences, I\u2019m passionate about building solutions that have a real impact on people\u2019s lives.\n\nLet\u2019s connect if you\u2019re interested in discussing technology, product management, or how we can work together to drive innovation."", ""educations"": [{""school"": ""College of Computing at Georgia Tech"", ""degree"": ""Bachelor of Science - BS"", ""major"": ""Computer Science"", ""start_date"": ""May 2020"", ""end_date"": ""Aug 2024"", ""description"": """"}, {""school"": ""Georgia Institute of Technology"", ""degree"": ""Bachelor of Science - BS"", ""major"": ""Computer Science"", ""start_date"": ""May 2020"", ""end_date"": ""Aug 2024"", ""description"": """"}, {""school"": ""Indian Hill High School"", ""degree"": null, ""major"": null, ""start_date"": ""Aug 2016"", ""end_date"": ""May 2020"", ""description"": """"}, {""school"": ""Stanford University"", ""degree"": ""Economics"", ""major"": null, ""start_date"": ""May 2018"", ""end_date"": ""Aug 2018"", ""description"": ""Grade: A""}, {""school"": ""The Ohio State University"", ""degree"": ""Software Engineering"", ""major"": null, ""start_date"": ""May 2018"", ""end_date"": ""Aug 2018"", ""description"": """"}], ""experiences"": [{""title"": ""Software Engineer Intern"", ""company"": ""Shipt"", ""work_type"": ""Internship"", ""start_date"": ""May 2022"", ""end_date"": ""Aug 2022"", ""location"": ""San Francisco, California, United States \u00b7 Hybrid"", ""description"": ""\u2022 Delivered 20 email formats based on UI team requirements, using HTML and CSS on the Google Cloud platform to reach 1,000,000 customers.\n\u2022 Tested iOS notifications as per requirements for 20 modules.\n\u2022 Evaluated marketing campaign performance based on impression data and brainstormed changes to UI design with the CRM team.\n\u2022 Collaborated with software engineers to develop and test application procedures for system efficiency on Google Cloud.\n\u2022 Sat in on design team and planning meetings.\n\u2022 Delivered weekly project reports and milestone updates.""}, {""title"": ""Product Manager"", ""company"": ""eClinicalWorks"", ""work_type"": ""Internship"", ""start_date"": ""May 2021"", ""end_date"": ""Aug 2021"", ""location"": ""Boston, Massachusetts, United States"", ""description"": ""\u2022 Implemented a process on Microsoft Azure to make JIRA ticket files available to the support team for 500+ customers.\n\u2022 Conducted market research to identify customer needs and preferences.\n\u2022 Maintained and updated project plan by tracking technical dependencies and issued project milestone updates using Azure DevOps.\n\u2022 Helped set up and run focus group with 3 participants to document product experiences and record feedback from consumers.\n\u2022 Collaborated with product managers and the engineering team on Microsoft Azure to document, validate, and monitor logging and metrics.\n\u2022 Assisted with customer needs and resolved problems using Azure-based tools to maintain business relationships.""}, {""title"": ""Product Manager Intern"", ""company"": ""The 808 Wave, LLC"", ""work_type"": ""Internship"", ""start_date"": ""Aug 2020"", ""end_date"": ""Dec 2020"", ""location"": ""Atlanta, Georgia, United States"", ""description"": ""\u2022 Managed Twitter accounts with 10,000+ followers and grew impressions to 1,000,000+ monthly.\n\u2022 Developed a creative Ad strategy for Facebook Ads by creating 1 minute long videos.""}, {""title"": ""Software Engineer Intern"", ""company"": ""The Western and Southern Life Insurance Company"", ""work_type"": ""Internship"", ""start_date"": ""Jul 2019"", ""end_date"": ""Aug 2019"", ""location"": ""Mason, Ohio, United States \u00b7 Hybrid"", ""description"": """"}], ""headline"": ""CS @ Georgia Institute of Technology"", ""id"": ""https://www.linkedin.com/in/anaygautham/"", ""location"": ""San Francisco Bay Area, California, United States"", ""name"": ""Anay G."", ""profile_pic"": ""https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D03AQFiGwBrG7QMSQ/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1716340582283?e=1749081600&v=beta&t=uGoyupQsOIfile6J8KbRLrPbTh5SDxFX7GyOmBe-IVc""}"

This also eliminates the Cisco proposed NCS 2000 hardware refresh to replace the ONS 15454 optical equipment. In addition, carrier level transport equipment will no longer need to reside on FDA property unless the carrier managed has a specific on premises requirement.  The standard solution was designed as a fully redundant backbone with 100G Metro Ethernet transport services provided by Verizon and Dark Fiber transport services with 100G capabilities provided by Zayo. The combined Metropolitan Area Network solutions provide the dual carrier and internal redundancy requirements to provide the necessary service level in support of the business operations and continuity. The Verizon MetroE solution would require a 100M Ethernet handoff with selective QnQ capabilities to each FDA Datacenter.  The QnQ technologies allows the FDA to select VLANs, layer 2 parameters, and differentiated services between the Datacenters, regardless of the L2 parameters defined by Verizon MetroE components.  \nThe Cisco platinum solution for the 100G backbone transport includes the MetroE connections that will terminate in each Datacenter to dual Cisco Nexus 7700 with F3 modules, which supports the 100G Ethernet requirements.
