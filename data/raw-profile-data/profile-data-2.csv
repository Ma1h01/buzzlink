Whether it\u2019s crafting an algorithm to solve a real-world problem, proving a mathematical theorem, or tackling Sudoku in my spare time, I thrive on piecing together solutions.

Early on, I explored a wide range of fields\u2014Physics, Philosophy, Social Sciences, and Engineering\u2014before discovering programming. That first coding class captivated me, combining logic, creativity, and problem-solving in ways that clicked perfectly with my mathematically inclined mind. From there, I immersed myself in Computer Science and Mathematics, combining technical rigor with my love for discovery and communication.\n\nAt the Georgia Institute of Technology, I completed three degrees in just four years: a Master of Science in Computer Science specializing in Machine Learning, a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with threads in Information Internetworks and Intelligence, and a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics with a focus on Probability and Statistics. Alongside my academic journey, I gained professional experience as a Mobile Engineer Intern at Expedia Group, a Software Engineer Intern at NCR, a Student Assistant at Southwest Research Institute, and an Undergraduate Researcher working on cutting-edge projects in semantic segmentation and statistical sampling.\n\nMy passion for communication complements my technical skills. As former President of the Great Conversations organization at Georgia Tech, I honed my ability to lead discussions on science, philosophy, and society\u2014an intersection where I believe the most meaningful ideas emerge. I strive to bring this balance of technical expertise and human connection to every role I take on.\n\nToday, as I embark on my professional journey with EY as a Data Engineer, Staff Consultant in the National AI & Data, Industrials & Energy Sector, I am excited to leverage my passion for AI and data to create impactful solutions while continuing to grow as a communicator and leader.\n\nOutside of work, I enjoy hiking, rock climbing, creating music, and exploring new ideas in science, technology, and philosophy.

In the name of simple solutions, I've learned a great deal about data science and system design to solve old problems in more interesting ways.\n\nMany of those old problems are the daily annoyances faced as a Linux fan. I\u2019m in the midst of solving 17 of them with ML-based open source software, which I\u2019ve documented in my blog in research-style articles. Designing these solutions has made me very comfortable starting from hazy requirements, exploring (often poorly documented) codebases, and doing so self-sufficiently. \n\nMy experience as a data science intern then made me effective in the work environment. I thought I was training the models to be predictive, but instead the models were training me to be resourceful! I learned how to ask the right people for help and alignment, how to connect new problems to my previous experiences, how to seek and incorporate feedback without taking it personally, and how to explain technical concepts to senior leadership.\n\nI believe this pragmatic curiosity is what makes me an effective problem solver, and I'll be sure to keep honing these skills in the future."", ""educations"": [{""school"": ""Georgia Institute of Technology"", ""degree"": ""Bachelor's degree"", ""major"": ""Computer Science"", ""start_date"": ""Aug 2022"", ""end_date"": ""May 2025"", ""description"": ""Grade: Junior""}], ""experiences"": [{""title"": ""Research Assistant"", ""company"": ""Systems for Machine Learning Lab at Georgia Tech"", ""work_type"": ""Full-time"", ""start_date"": ""Aug 2024"", ""end_date"": ""Present"", ""location"": ""Atlanta, Georgia, United States \u00b7 On-site"", ""description"": ""- Experimenting with memory management mechanisms and scheduling policies to minimize latency of LLM inference on Nvidia GH200 chips\n- In a nutshell, the inference of very large models is actually bound by the speed of the memory rather than the speed of the processors, like a skilled chef idly waiting on a shipment.
