I'm passionate about innovating on an interdisciplinary level and applying artificial intelligence, cloud solutions across industries to create tangible, real world impact. My interests span across Software Engineering, Product Management, and Artificial Intelligence. I look forward to being able to apply my skills to help transform businesses and create social good.\n\nMy experiences at Georgia Tech and during my internship at Amazon (AWS), where I helped optimize a core service for global scalability, have helped me develop a strong technical foundation and object-oriented programming skills. I've learnt the lasting impact and importance of designing scalable solutions in enterprise software. Likewise, my internships at Glance and Qdeck.ai have helped expose me to the transformative impact of Machine Learning and Generative AI.\n\nSimilarly, my experience building my own startup, Spoony.ai, has given me hands-on experience in building solutions that address real customer needs, learning that true innovation lies in aligning technology with practical problem-solving. It's now clear to me that the key ingredients to building a successful product is spread beyond just high quality software.\n\nI'm a quick learner, critical thinker, and am motivated to drive impact.",

These technologies are connected through a local Ethernet network, which I optimized using TCP/IP Ethernet protocol by using Python socket programming to connect multiple computers to one another. Electronic ARTrium also includes a barcode-ticketing system to keep track of player information, meant to replicate barcodes used in real-life events such as concerts and amusement parks. I streamlined the ticketing system using Python to generate unique barcodes, which is then scanned by barcode scanners. Through ethernet, barcode data is saved to a MySQL database, which SQL queries can access. Lastly, I directed other team members by establishing timelines for tasks, reviewing code for pull requests, provided resources and tutorials, and directed the creation of design notebooks."

Examples of rates are 20% off of meals or $15 worth of free items for small influencers, while larger influencers would get more compensation. Afterward, I then kept in touch and negotiated to make sure that bloggers and influencers would create media that would represent the restaurant, allowing for greater outreach to people on social media.

I am a very strong advocate of Wikipedia in Hebrew and actively canvas multiple Israeli Government Ministries continuously to budget more finance to translate existing Wikipedia Articles in other languages to Hebrew. Hebrew Wikipedia has about 191,000 articles as of June 2016. The first article in Hebrew was published in May 2001.Wikipedia Articles are  not technically copyrighted but if its content is used , the source should be acknowledged in full and accurately and with the URL link.From its inception in 2001, Wikipedia articles have been regarded as credible and acceptable academic sources (subject to any editorial comment) Wikipedia can best be described as Crowd Editing. Anyone can register on Wikipedia and contribute to an exciting article or start one of their own. Anything added to articles are closely monitored and checked under very well defined guidelines of Wikipedia.There are absolutely no bylines or acknowledgement of authorship of Wikipedia  articles , Any contributions to Wikipedia are probono with no exceptions.The English Edition of Wikipedia has grown to over  5,171,461 articles,( as a t11th June 2016 6am GMT)equivalent to over 2,000 print volumes of the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica.

At the Cardiovascular Fluid Mechanics Lab, I built machine learning models using Python that accurately predicted post-TAVR aortic arch stretch, reducing surgical planning time by 25%. My work with AI improved predictive model accuracy by 15%, boosting overall efficiency by 18%.As a Biomedical Engineer Intern at MiRus, I designed new medical devices using SolidWorks, which increased procedural success rates by 29%. I also coordinated with over 50 suppliers to ensure timely delivery and quality of materials, effectively managing project schedules and budgets.In my role at Flow MedTech, I led a team to run simulations that improved device reliability and reduced failure rates by 25%. This experience also helped me enhance financial strategies, resulting in a 20% increase in asset value.I have a passion for data science. One of my projects involved creating statistical shape models of the aortic root using ShapeWorks and Blender, which improved model accuracy by 28% and reduced costs by 12%.I am skilled in programming languages and software like Python, MATLAB, SolidWorks, and ShapeWorks. I also hold certifications in Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and various biomedical research areas.Connect with me via LinkedIn or Email (akshita.j1702@gmail.com) to see how my skills in machine learning, AI, financial systems, and biomedical engineering can benefit your projects.",

I am proficient in Java, Python, and C and have experience leading projects in machine learning, robotics, and product testing. I enjoy projects centered on collaboration, creative thinking, and problem solving. I have supervised the implementation of terrain classification mechanisms on a humanoid robot at Georgia Tech\u9225\u6a9a Laboratory for Intelligent Decision and Autonomous Robots. I have also developed technology to streamline the hardware testing process for industrial-level CPU systems. I enjoy projects that are challenging and allow me to learn diverse skill sets along the way. I strive to create results that are impactful, whether that's in making a process more efficient or developing a product that can solve a prevalent issue.",
