https://www.linkedin.com/in/mason-carrington-60aa11261,"{""about"": ""Hello, I'm Mason. I am currently attending the Georgia Institute of Technology, and am in the process of achieving a Bachelor's of Science in Business Administration with a minor in Computer Science. I am currently in my second year of college, and have loved the new experiences and chances to grow, that I've been given. I have been employed at the Georgia Tech Campus Recreation Center since October of 2023. Over the 2024 summer, I worked an internship position with the Kasama Farm Foundation.\n\nDuring my time on campus, I have been involved with the clubs Diversity in Business and Georgia Tech Society of Black Engineers. I am also a recent initiate of the Georgia Institute of Technology Chapter, the Lambda Delta Chapter, of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, Inc.\n\nI attended Chamblee High School from 2019 until my graduation in 2023. While there I was a part of the football and volleyball teams, the orchestra, and the Black Excellence Understood Club. I also worked at as a clerk at QuikTrip starting in the summer of 2022.\n\nWhat led me to a business administration major was my interest in figuring out how to improve on something. It is as if I am solving a puzzle and the end goal is to be able to produce a better, more defined, and efficient product. Throughout my life, I have learned the importance of having great a work ethic, being able to work creatively, and bouncing back from adversity. I think those are some of the most important traits a business person should have.
