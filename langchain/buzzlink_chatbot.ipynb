        "2. Inaccurate Canonical Rewriting: While the model does attempt to rewrite user queries into a canonical form, it merely echoes a generic template instead of accurately extracting and populating key details from the original query. This significantly degrades both retrieval accuracy and the quality of the generated answers.\n",
