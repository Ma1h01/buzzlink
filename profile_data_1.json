I'm passionate about innovating on an interdisciplinary level and applying artificial intelligence, cloud solutions across industries to create tangible, real world impact. My interests span across Software Engineering, Product Management, and Artificial Intelligence. I look forward to being able to apply my skills to help transform businesses and create social good.\n\nMy experiences at Georgia Tech and during my internship at Amazon (AWS), where I helped optimize a core service for global scalability, have helped me develop a strong technical foundation and object-oriented programming skills. I've learnt the lasting impact and importance of designing scalable solutions in enterprise software. Likewise, my internships at Glance and Qdeck.ai have helped expose me to the transformative impact of Machine Learning and Generative AI.\n\nSimilarly, my experience building my own startup, Spoony.ai, has given me hands-on experience in building solutions that address real customer needs, learning that true innovation lies in aligning technology with practical problem-solving. It's now clear to me that the key ingredients to building a successful product is spread beyond just high quality software.\n\nI'm a quick learner, critical thinker, and am motivated to drive impact.",

I streamlined the ticketing system using Python to generate unique barcodes, which is then scanned by barcode scanners.

The app aims to promote a healthy lifestyle by allowing users to track the calories they eat after meals, and replicate a digital supermarket where they can store and then buy ingredients for various recipes. The first step involved designing the app by working with team members to create different diagrams, such as a DCD (Design Class Diagram) meant to visualize possible scenarios and components of the application. Then, my team followed an agile-based approach by writing code for different elements, reviewing them through pull requests, and making changes gradually. We utilized MVVM architecture and implemented coding design patterns such as the Observer pattern to improve efficiency. Major contributions that I made towards the project involved developing the storage of data by using Firebase, a cloud-based NoSQL database to store user data. Examples of user data stored were email and passwords for login information,  calories they input in the app, and shopping lists. Another contribution was making complex UI elements, such as logic for switching screens and creating scrollable lists on the app."

We designed the database to store various data, such as information about a buyer, employee, products, lists of orders, drones, and deliveries.
