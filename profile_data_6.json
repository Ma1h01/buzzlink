At the Cardiovascular Fluid Mechanics Lab, I built machine learning models using Python that accurately predicted post-TAVR aortic arch stretch, reducing surgical planning time by 25%. My work with AI improved predictive model accuracy by 15%, boosting overall efficiency by 18%.As a Biomedical Engineer Intern at MiRus, I designed new medical devices using SolidWorks, which increased procedural success rates by 29%. I also coordinated with over 50 suppliers to ensure timely delivery and quality of materials, effectively managing project schedules and budgets.In my role at Flow MedTech, I led a team to run simulations that improved device reliability and reduced failure rates by 25%. This experience also helped me enhance financial strategies, resulting in a 20% increase in asset value.I have a passion for data science. One of my projects involved creating statistical shape models of the aortic root using ShapeWorks and Blender, which improved model accuracy by 28% and reduced costs by 12%.I am skilled in programming languages and software like Python, MATLAB, SolidWorks, and ShapeWorks. I also hold certifications in Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and various biomedical research areas.Connect with me via LinkedIn or Email (akshita.j1702@gmail.com) to see how my skills in machine learning, AI, financial systems, and biomedical engineering can benefit your projects.",
