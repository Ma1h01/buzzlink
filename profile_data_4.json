                "description": "Last weekend, Samuel Khang and I had the opportunity to participate and win the \ud83c\udfc6 Best AI Application built with Cloudflare at #Hacklytics2025, hosted by Data Science @ GT! \n\nSam and I personally have had trouble with pain and injury with our squat forms at the gym. That's why, over the weekend, we built \ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f\u200d SquatSpot, an AI-powered squat analysis tool that provides real-time feedback on weightlifting form!\n\nSquatSpot analyzes your squat form with 11+ biomechanical metrics in real-time through your camera or uploaded videos. It compares your form against both a population of elite lifters and any video of your choice, and gives you a calculated similarity score. SquatSpot also provides personalized AI feedback on how to improve your form by tracking your progress over multiple reps and identifies specific areas for improvement. \n\n\ud83d\ude80 Technologies Used:\n\n- Computer Vision Engine: Used MediaPipe and OpenCV to track 33 body landmarks in real-time for precise pose estimation\n- AI Feedback: Integrated Cloudflare Workers AI with LLaMA 3.1 to generate personalized form corrections\n- React + Flask Stack: Built responsive frontend in React.js with a Flask backend for seamless video processing and metric analysis\n\nA huge thank you to #Hacklytics2025 and the organizational team for a great weekend!\n\n\u2705 Check out the project here:\nGithub - https://lnkd.in/eGKJUmne\nDevpost Submission - https://lnkd.in/eryxnvtb"
